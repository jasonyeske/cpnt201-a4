- If I could go back, I would have added commits for adding text into the modules in nuxt.config.js, I just forgot and was annoyed by the installation process

- [Nuxt Robots](https://github.com/nuxt-community/robots-module)
- [nuxt google analytics](https://google-analytics.nuxtjs.org/setup)

- I chose the robots package honestly because it sounded cool
- I tried installing google analytics and it kept on breaking my assignment and I had to restart the whole installation process.
